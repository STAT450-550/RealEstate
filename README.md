## Project background
Every year, all property owners in BC have to pay property taxes&mdash;the single greatest operating expense. The property tax is determined based on property assessment and property tax rate (mill rates). This project will be a value-add to the business in projecting commercial real estate property taxes, and providing tax and assessment insights for different neighborhoods/and or property types. If time allow, a statistical research question can be explored.

## Project objectives
* To **predict** the property tax for a given property for the upcoming year.
* To invent an **automated** Model/Report to **show insights** on assessment values and trend for a given area and/or property type (preferably exportable to Excel).
* **Hypotheses/Question:** What is the true relationship between property tax and assessment value in the past few years? For example, if the assessment has increased/decreased (for an area/municipality), will the property tax increase/decrease as well? If so, by how much?

## Directory roadmap
(We may want to edit this once we have better-defined folders. Below an example.)
Each directory includes its own README file. In general:
* `doc` includes the written portions of the project: main, sections, appendices, and project outline tex/pdfs/aux files.
* `misc` contains miscelaneous files.
* `ref` has the bib file for generating the project's references.
* `src` includes the R code developed for the project.
